- For a couple days (few hours a day):
    + discovered geodata for zipcodes -> tracts -> counties
    + discovered ways of manipulating the data via CLI
        using tools developed by Mike Bostock: ndjson-* etc..

- 3/25/19 3pm
    + made outline of activities
    + planning time each task will take

- 3/26/19 11am
    + thinking the process of data cleaning/formatting is getting a little out of hand
    + trying to keep it as organized as possible without changing the process too much
       - but will have to think of a better pipeline later..

    + making progress on zip 2 county mapping and getting county data

- 4/12/19
    + made some progress on UI:
        - added slider for years
        - added colors to zipcodes

- 4/13/19
    + attempt to make weather request:
        - but running into issues with CORS 
            (request cross origin/domain from browser)
        - so will have to create a backend api
    + spent too much time reading the cors docs:
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20361893/no-access-control-allow-origin-header-is-present-on-the-requested-resource-err
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
    + Then getting lost here:
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin
        + trial and error only resulted in errors. 

        - i think its a server config mainly...

    + then encountered this:
        https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/calling-openweathermap-api-is-blocked-due-to-cors-header-access-control-allow-origin-missing/191868
        ie: just use https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com
        as a proxy to request weather

        >> PERFECT
