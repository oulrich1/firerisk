- For a couple days (few hours a day):
    + discovered geodata for zipcodes -> tracts -> counties
    + discovered ways of manipulating the data via CLI
        using tools developed by Mike Bostock: ndjson-* etc..

- 3/25/18 3pm
    + made outline of activities
    + planning time each task will take

- 3/26/18 11am
    + thinking the process of data cleaning/formatting is getting a little out of hand
    + trying to keep it as organized as possible without changing the process too much
       - but will have to think of a better pipeline later..

    + making progress on zip 2 county mapping and getting county data
